        <p>After reading about John Von Neumann's research on creating self replicating machines, Conway was inspired to distill Neumann's original 29 states to the bare essentials.</p>
        <p>Over the course of 18 months of coffee breaks with his colleagues at Princeton, he devised a set of rules and expectations by experimenting on a go board.</p>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation or exposure).</li>
          <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding).</li>
          <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.</li>
